/**
 * Problem 1123: Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves
 * Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
 *
 * Recall that:
 * - The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
 * - The depth of the root of the tree is 0, and if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1
 * - The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree of A
